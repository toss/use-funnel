  <p style="font-size:18px;">A powerful and safe step-by-step state management library</p>
</div>

`@use-funnel` is a [React Hook](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) that helps you easily implement complex UI flows.

## Concepts

### Strong Type Support

By comparing the type of the current step with the type of the next step, you can safely manage only the necessary states.

### State Management by History

Manage states by history, so you can easily manage back and forth.

### Various Router Support

Supports browser history, react-router-dom, next.js, @react-navigation/native, etc.
