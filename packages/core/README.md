`@use-funnel` is a [React Hook](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) that helps you easily implement complex UI flows.

## Core Concepts

### Strong Type Support

By comparing the type of the current step with the next, you can ensure that only the required states are managed safely.

### State Management by History

Manage states based on history, making it easy to handle backward and forward navigation.

### Various Router Support

Supports browser history, react-router, next.js, @react-navigation/native, and more.
