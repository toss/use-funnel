# Define Transition Events

Transition events allow you to define and control how the current step transitions to the next step based on specific conditions or user actions. They are useful when multiple paths are needed within a funnel. For example, when a user enters an email, you may need to handle the case where the input is successful differently from when it fails.

Transition events are particularly useful when multiple paths are required within the current step. You can define multiple paths that can occur in the current step at once, enabling you to write more cohesive code.

Here's an example of defining and using transition events.

```tsx
import { useFunnel } from "@use-funnel/next";

const funnel = useFunnel(/* ... */);

<funnel.Render
  EmailInput={funnel.Render.with({
    events: {
      // Email input success event
      EmailInputSuccess: (email: string, { history }) => {
        // Transition to the password input step
        history.push('PasswordInput', { email });
      },
      // Email input fail event
      EmailInputFail: (error: Error, { history }) => {
        // Transition to the error page
        history.push('ErrorPage', { error: error.message });
      }
    },
    render({ context, dispatch }) {
      return (
        <EmailInput
          email={context.email}
          // Dispatch EmailInputSuccess event when email input is successful
          onNext={(email) => dispatch('EmailInputSuccess', email)}
          // Dispatch EmailInputFail event when email input fails
          onError={(error) => dispatch('EmailInputFail', error)}
        />
      );
    }
  })}
/>
```

This example shows how to define and use transition events. Once the events for the email input step are defined, you can trigger the appropriate event using `dispatch()`.

Here's the type definition for a rendering object that includes an event object.

```ts
interface FunnelRenderWithEvent<
  TEvents extends {
    [eventName: string]: (payload: any, context: FunnelRenderContext) => void
  },
  TEventDispatch extends {
    [eventName in keyof TEvents]: (payload: Parameters<TEvents[eventName]>[0]) => void
  }[keyof TEvents]
> {
  events: TEvents,
  render: (props: { context: Context; dispatch: TEventDispatch }) => React.ReactNode
}
```

- `events` (`object`, required): An object mapping event names to their respective handlers.
  - `eventName` (`string`): The name of the event.
  - `payload` (`any`): The data passed to the event handler.
  - `context` (`object`): An object representing the state of the current step.
- `render` (`function`): A function that returns a React node.
  - `context` (`object`): An object representing the state of the current step.
  - `dispatch` (`function`): A function that triggers the specified event.

<Callout type="warning">
You cannot use `history` in the rendering function when defining events. Instead, you should trigger the events defined in the `events` object using `dispatch()`.
