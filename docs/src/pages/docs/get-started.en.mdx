# Getting Started

Let's implement a simple sign-up flow using `@use-funnel`. You'll learn how to define and manage the state of each step safely and step by step.

<Steps>
### Defining <Keyword>context</Keyword> step by step

The sign-up process can be divided into several steps. Here, we'll divide it into three steps: email input, password input, and other information input. And we'll define the state required for each step as follows.

```tsx filename="context.ts"
// 1. Nothing entered
type EmailInputType = { email?: string; password?: string; other?: unknown }
// 2. Email entered
type PasswordInputType = { email: string; password?: string; other?: unknown }
// 3. Email and password entered
type OtherInfoInputType = { email: string; password: string; other?: unknown }
```

- `EmailInputType`: The first step of sign-up. Although there are email and password input fields, nothing has been entered yet. Both `email` and `password` are defined as optional fields.

- `PasswordInputType`: The second step of sign-up. After the user enters the email, they enter the password. In this step, the `email` field must be entered, and the `password` is an optional field.

- `OtherInfoInputType`: The third step of sign-up. After the user enters both the email and password, they enter additional information. In this step, both `email` and `password` must be entered.

By defining the state of each step as a type, you can maintain [type safety](./features.mdx#ui-state-managed-with-strong-type-safety) in your code and easily track the information required for each step.

### Configuring the initial step

Now let's set the initial step using [`useFunnel()`](./use-funnel).

First, specify the object type with the key as the step and the context object as the value in the generics of [`useFunnel()`](./use-funnel). Pass the type you defined for each step in the previous step to [`useFunnel()`](./use-funnel). Set the inital step and context object to be used when entering the component in the `initial` property.

Here, we set the initial step to "EmailInput" and an empty `context` object to be used in that step. `id` is a unique identifier to distinguish when there are multiple funnels in one component.

<UseFunnelCodeBlock>
```tsx {5-15}
import { useFunnel } from "@use-funnel/next";
import type { EmailInputType, PasswordInputType, OtherInfoInputType } "./context";

function MyFunnelApp() {
  const funnel = useFunnel<{
    EmailInput: EmailInputType;
    PasswordInput: PasswordInputType;
    OtherInfoInput: OtherInfoInputType;
  }>({
    id: "my-funnel-app",
    initial: {
      step: "EmailInput",
      context: {}
    }
  });
  // ...
}
```
</UseFunnelCodeBlock>

For other ways to define the state of each step, see the [state definition guide](/docs/context-guide).

### Using <Keyword>context</Keyword> and <Keyword>history</Keyword> step by step

[`useFunnel()`](./use-funnel) returns `context` and `history` based on the `step`. You can configure the UI for each step and manage the required state and events.

```tsx
declare function EmailInput(props: { onNext: (email: string) => void }): JSX.Element;
declare function PasswordInput(props: { onNext: (password: string) => void }): JSX.Element;
declare function OtherInfoInput(props: { onNext: (other: unknown) => void }): JSX.Element;

switch (funnel.step) {
  case "EmailInput":
    return <EmailInput onNext={(email) => funnel.history.push("PasswordInput", { email })} />;
  case "PasswordInput":
    return <PasswordInput email={funnel.context.email} onNext={(password) => funnel.history.push("OtherInfoInput", { ...funnel.context, password })} />;
  case "OtherInfoInput":
    return <OtherInfoInput onNext={(other) => funnel.history.push("Finish", { ...funnel.context, other })} />;
}
```

- `funnel.context{:jsx}`: You can get the `context` of the current `step`. For example, in the "EmailInput" step, `funnel.context.email` is of type `string | undefined`, but in the "PasswordInput" step, it can be inferred as type `string`.
- `funnel.history.push(){:jsx}`: You can move to the next step. Pass the desired `step` as the first argument to `push()` and the necessary `context` for that `step` as the second argument.
- `funnel.history.replace(){:jsx}`: It's basic behavior is similar to `funnel.history.push()`, but it replaces the current `step` without adding to the history stack.

#### Note: Implementing easily using `<funnel.Render />`

To centralize the rendering logic for each step, you can use `<funnel.Render />`. This component allows you to define the rendering logic for each step and pass the necessary data for each step.

```tsx
return (
  <funnel.Render
    EmailInput={({ history }) => (
      <EmailInput onNext={(email) => history.push("PasswordInput", { email })} />
    )}
    PasswordInput={({ context, history }) => (
      <PasswordInput email={context.email} onNext={(password) => history.push("OtherInfoInput", { ...context, password })} />
    )}
    OtherInfoInput={({ context, history }) => (
      <OtherInfoInput onNext={(other) => history.push("Finish", { ...context, other })} />
    )}
    Finish={() => <Finish />}
  />
);
```

The detailed usage of the [`<funnel.Render />`](./funnel-render) component is available in the [reference](/docs/funnel-render).
