# Migrating from @toss/use-funnel

This document explains how to migrate code from [@toss/use-funnel](https://www.slash.page/ko/libraries/react/use-funnel/README.i18n) to the new `@use-funnel`. Since `@toss/use-funnel` was written for Next.js Page Router, this document focuses on migrating to `@use-funnel/next`.

## New Benefits

- Fixed issues where state did not follow history ([related document](https://use-funnel.slash.page/ko/docs/features#%EC%89%AC%EC%9A%B4-%ED%9E%88%EC%8A%A4%ED%86%A0%EB%A6%AC-%EC%83%81%ED%83%9C-%EA%B4%80%EB%A6%AC))
- Allows defining state for each step
- Supports not only Next.js but also `react-router-dom` and `@react-navigation/native`

## Installation

See [Installation](https://use-funnel.slash.page/ko/docs/install) for more details.

```shell npm2yarn
npm install @use-funnel/next --save
```

## Breaking Changes

### Migrating Steps

The new `@use-funnel` allows defining not just the steps but also the state for each step. If your funnel in `@toss/use-funnel` does not require different states for each step, you can use `createFunnelSteps()` provided by `@use-funnel`.

<CodeCompare>
```tsx showLineNumbers {3}
import { useFunnel } from '@toss/use-funnel';

const FUNNEL_STEPS = ['A', 'B', 'C'] as const;
const [Funnel, setFunnel] = useFunnel(FUNNEL_STEPS);
```
```tsx showLineNumbers {3-5,8}
import { createFunnelSteps } from '@use-funnel/next';

const steps = createFunnelSteps()
  .extends(['A', 'B', 'C'])
  .build();
  
const funnel = useFunnel({
  steps,
  initial: {
    step: 'A',
    context: {}
  }
});
```
</CodeCompare>

### Migrating `<Funnel />`, `<Funnel.Step />` Components

In `@use-funnel`, you no longer need separate components to infer state types for each step. Instead, you can use `funnel.step` and `funnel.context` returned by `useFunnel()` and render based on `switch-case` statements.

<CodeCompare>
```tsx
import { useFunnel } from '@toss/use-funnel';

const [Funnel, setFunnel] = useFunnel([
  'A', 'B'
] as const);

return (
  <Funnel>
    <Funnel.Step name="A">
      <div>A</div>
    </Funnel.Step>
    <Funnel.Step name="B">
      <div>B</div>
    </Funnel.Step>
  </Funnel>
)
```
```tsx
import { useFunnel } from '@use-funnel/next';

const steps = createFunnelSteps().extends(['A', 'B']).build();
const funnel = useFunnel({
  steps,
  initial: {
    step: 'A',
    context: {}
  }
});

switch (funnel.step) {
  case 'A':
    return <div>A</div>;
  case 'B':
    return <div>B</div>;
}
```
</CodeCompare>

Alternatively, you can use `<funnel.Render />` for a more declarative approach. See the [funnel.Render component](/docs/funnel-render) for more details.

### Migrating `withState()`

If you were using `withState()` in `@toss/use-funnel`, you can now achieve the same functionality by passing a generic to `createFunnelSteps()`.

<CodeCompare>
```tsx showLineNumbers {5-11}
import { useFunnel } from '@toss/use-funnel';

const [Funnel, state, setState] = useFunnel([
  'A', 'B', 'C'
] as const).withState<{
  foo?: string;
  bar?: number;
}>({
  foo: 'Hello',
  bar: 5
});
```
```tsx showLineNumbers {3-6,12-15}
import { useFunnel, createFunnelSteps } from '@use-funnel/next';

const steps = createFunnelSteps<{
  foo?: string;
  bar?: number;
}>().extends(['A', 'B', 'C']).build();

const funnel = useFunnel({
  steps,
  initial: {
    step: 'A',
    context: {
      foo: 'Hello',
      bar: 5
    }
  }
});
```
