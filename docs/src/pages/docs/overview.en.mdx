`@use-funnel` is a [React Hook](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) that helps you easily implement complex UI flows.

In the example screen on the right, you can see the UI flow where users enter their occupation → school / company → registration date in order. You can also move to the previous step by going back. To implement such a complex UI flow, you need to manage step-by-step states and history.

With `@use-funnel`, you can easily implement such a UI flow.
