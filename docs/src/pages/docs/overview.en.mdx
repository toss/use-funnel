`@use-funnel` is a [React Hook](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) that simplifies the implementation of complex UI flows.

In the example on the right, you can see a UI flow where users sequentially enter their occupation, school or company, and registration date. You can also move to the previous step by going back. Implementing such a complex UI flow requires managing step-by-step states and history.

With `@use-funnel`, you can easily implement these mobile-friendly UI flows.
