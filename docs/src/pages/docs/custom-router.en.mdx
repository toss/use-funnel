# Creating a Custom Router

`@use-funnel` stores state snapshots of each funnel step in an array, enabling stable backward and forward navigation. Here’s how to create a custom router without relying on the built-in functions provided by router packages.

First, install the `@use-funnel/core` package

```shell npm2yarn
npm install @use-funnel/core --save
```

Here’s an example of implementing a funnel using only [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState), without a router.

```tsx filename="src/hooks/useFunnel.ts"
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';
import { createUseFunnel } from '@use-funnel/core';

// Define the useFunnel hook using the createUseFunnel function.
export const useFunnel = createUseFunnel(({ id, initialState }) => {
  // history manages the array of state snapshots for the funnel.
  const [history, setHistory] = useState(() => [initialState]);
  // currentIndex manages the index of the current funnel step.
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);

  return useMemo(
    () => ({
      // Returns the history and currentIndex, representing the current state of the funnel.
      history,
      currentIndex,
      // push function adds a new state and updates the current index.
      push(state) {
        setHistory((prev) => {
          const next = prev.slice(0, currentIndex + 1);
          return [...next, state];
        });
        setCurrentIndex((prev) => prev + 1);
      },
      // replace function replaces the current state and updates the state snapshot.
      replace(state) {
        setHistory((prev) => {
          const next = prev.slice(0, currentIndex);
          return [...next, state];
        });
      },
      // go function moves the current index by delta.
      go(delta) {
        setCurrentIndex((prev) => prev + delta);
      },
    }),
    [history, currentIndex] // Returns memoized values whenever history and currentIndex change.
  );
});
```

The above code example uses `useState` to manage the funnel’s state. The `createUseFunnel` function creates a hook that manages the array of state snapshots (`history`) and the current index (`currentIndex`).

- `push(state)`: Adds a new state and updates the current index.
- `replace(state)`: Overwrites the current state with a new state and updates the state snapshot.
- `go(delta)`: Moves the current index by `delta`.

Next, let's look at the `CreateUseFunnelOptions<T>` interface for the options object passed to `createUseFunnel()`.

```tsx
interface CreateUseFunnelOptions<T> {
  /**
   * A unique identifier for the funnel. This distinguishes global state when there are multiple funnels on one page.
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * The initial state of the funnel passed as `initial` in `useFunnel()`. This state is used at the entry of the funnel.
   */
  initialState: FunnelState<T>;
}

/**
 * An interface representing the state of the funnel. `step` indicates the name of the funnel step, and `context` represents the state required for that step.
 */
interface FunnelState<T> {
  step: string;
  context: T;
}
```

Finally, let’s examine the `CreateUseFunnelResult<T>` interface, which that describes the result returned by `createUseFunnel()`. This interface includes methods for managing funnel state and transitions.

```tsx
interface CreateUseFunnelResult<T> {
  /**
   * An array of state snapshots of the funnel. It holds the routing history accumulated after entering the funnel.
   */
  history: FunnelState<T>[];
  /**
   * The index of the current funnel step in progress.
   */
  currentIndex: number;
  /**
   * Implements the action of adding a new state to the current `history` and moving to the next funnel step.
   */
  push(state: FunnelState<T>): void | Promise<void>;
  /**
   * Implements the action of overwriting the current `history` with a new state and moving to the next funnel step.
   */
  replace(state: FunnelState<T>): void | Promise<void>;
  /**
   * Implements the action of moving by `delta` in the `history` array.
   */
  go(delta: number): void or Promise<void>;
}
```

This interface includes various methods to manage the funnel state and handle step transitions, ensuring robust state management for your funnel.
